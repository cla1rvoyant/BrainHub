              <h1>Your health depends on:</h1>
              <h1>Compliance with safety measures</h1>
              <p>If COVID-19 is spread in your area, take simple precautions: keep a safe distance from others, wear a mask, ventilate the area well, avoid crowded places, wash your hands and cover your nose and mouth with the bend of your elbow or a tissue when you cough. or sneezing. Follow the recommendations for your locality and place of work.</p>
                <h1>Rules for wearing a mask</h1>
                <p>1. If you put on or take off the mask, or touch it, perform hand hygiene.<br>
                  2. Put on the mask so that it covers your nose, mouth and chin.<br>
                  3. After removing the mask, put it in a clean plastic bag; fabric masks must be washed daily, medical masks must be disposed of with household waste.<br>
                  4. Do not use masks with valves.</p>
                  <h1>Avoiding confined spaces where people are huddled or in contact</h1>
                  <p>Outbreaks of the disease have been reported among restaurant diners, choir members, visitors to fitness clubs, nightclubs, offices and places of worship, often with a history of being indoors, in which people talk loudly, scream, breathe or sing loudly. <br>
                    Long-term stay of large numbers of people in close proximity to each other in poorly ventilated rooms increases the risk of contracting COVID-19. Obviously, in such conditions, the virus spreads more efficiently through droplets or aerosols, and therefore the importance of taking preventive measures increases.</p>
