              <h1>Compliance with safety measures</h1>
              <p>If COVID-19 is spread in your area, take simple precautions: keep a safe distance from others, wear a mask, ventilate the area well, avoid crowded places, wash your hands and cover your nose and mouth with the bend of your elbow or a tissue when you cough. or sneezing. Follow the recommendations for your locality and place of work.</p>
                <h1>Rules for wearing a mask</h1>
                <p>1. If you put on or take off the mask, or touch it, perform hand hygiene.<br>
                  2. Put on the mask so that it covers your nose, mouth and chin.<br>
                  3. After removing the mask, put it in a clean plastic bag; fabric masks must be washed daily, medical masks must be disposed of with household waste.<br>
                  4. Do not use masks with valves.</p>
                  <h1>Avoiding confined spaces where people are huddled or in contact</h1>
                  <p>Outbreaks of the disease have been reported among restaurant diners, choir members, visitors to fitness clubs, nightclubs, offices and places of worship, often with a history of being indoors, in which people talk loudly, scream, breathe or sing loudly. <br>
                    Long-term stay of large numbers of people in close proximity to each other in poorly ventilated rooms increases the risk of contracting COVID-19. Obviously, in such conditions, the virus spreads more efficiently through droplets or aerosols, and therefore the importance of taking preventive measures increases.</p>

      <h1>What does our health depend on?</h1>
      <p class="header-text">It is known that 50-55% of our health depends on ourselves - on our lifestyle. The environment has fixed its impact on health at around 20%. Our precious health depends on genetic predisposition by 18-20%, and only 8-10% depends on the public health system.<br>
        Separate components of a healthy lifestyle:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Sunlight</li>
          <p>Under the influence of ultraviolet rays of the sun in human skin, vitamin D is produced, which not only strengthens bones, but is also a good remedy for depression. Adequate levels of this vitamin protect against many diseases, so it is extremely important to get vitamin D while walking. In addition, sunlight has a beneficial effect on the human psyche, causing positive emotions, which also have a beneficial effect on overall well-being.</p>
          <li>Air</li>
          <p>Fresh air, saturated with negatively charged ions and oxygen, also has a beneficial effect on the general condition of the body. Its lack can cause headaches, sleep disturbance, irritability, aggressiveness, decreased concentration, and deterioration in mental abilities. Sometimes for clarity of thought it is enough to take a few deep breaths. It is necessary to regularly ventilate your home, learn to breathe with your “belly” (diaphragmatic type of breathing) and ensure good ventilation while cooking in the kitchen, especially if gas stoves are used for this.</p>
          <li>Water</li>
          <p>For the normal functioning of our body, it is enough to consume 1.5–2 liters of liquid per day, 2/3 of which should be ordinary water. With a lack of water, you may experience: headache (usually it is enough to drink 1-2 glasses of water to make it disappear), fatigue, general weakness, irritability, sleep disturbance, etc.</p>
          <li>Balanced diet</li>
          <p>The main principle of a balanced diet is moderation and variety, because the body must receive all the necessary nutrients and trace elements.
            The basis of nutrition should be cereals, wholemeal bread and pasta, potatoes, fruits and vegetables, which are rich in fiber, phytochemicals, vitamins and minerals. According to WHO recommendations, a person should consume at least 200 g of fruits and 300 vegetables per day. Also, the diet should definitely include dairy and sour-milk products, eggs and legumes, fish and lean meats, as well as nuts and seeds.
            From fats, preference is given to vegetable oils, but sweets, pastries and other sweets should be consumed in very limited quantities, for example, on weekends or holidays.
            A healthy and balanced diet is the basis for the prevention of many diseases.</p>
            <li>Physical exercise</li>
            <p>Physical exercise not only improves metabolism and blood circulation in the body, but also helps to strengthen immunity, lower cholesterol and normalize metabolism.
              An adult needs to take at least 10,000 steps a day. Aerobics, running, swimming or other sports for at least 30-40 minutes 5 times a week will also be useful.
              The easiest way to motivate yourself to move more is to get a treadmill and watch your favorite TV series and programs not lying on the couch, but doing it at home.</p>
              <li>Rest</li>
              <p>A person needs daily, weekly and annual rest, which depends on the main activity. For example, during hard physical labor, rest means getting enough sleep, reading an interesting book, or just sitting in your favorite chair. If the work is sedentary, then visiting the gym and chatting with friends in the fresh air will be the best rest.</p>
              <li>Abstinence</li>
              <p>According to experts, abstinence is a complete rejection of the harmful and moderation in the useful. For example, smoking, the use of narcotic drugs, large doses of alcohol, as well as unprotected sex with a partner who obviously has a sexually transmitted disease are definitely harmful to human health. Therefore, to preserve your health, it is best to refuse from this. On the other hand, daily exercise strengthens the body, but excessive exercise can exhaust it and lead to disease. The same is true with eating or wanting to work overtime.
                According to studies in which centenarians took part, they were united not only by a balanced diet and a sufficient amount of physical activity, but also by a positive, optimistic attitude to life, the ability to enjoy everyday little things. Therefore, leading a healthy lifestyle in a spiritual sense means noticing the positive in everyday life, rejoicing more often, treating problems more easily and being at peace with yourself.</p>
